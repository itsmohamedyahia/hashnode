If you do `Ctrl + G` in nano text editor to read the list of shortcuts, you will encounter some shortcuts staring with `^` caret symbol while others start with `M-`. At first glance, you might think thats the letter M on your keyboard but actually it is a different key that was found on older keyboards called the meta key. 

Since modern keyboards dont have this key. The `Alt` key in windows performs the same as meta key while the `Esc` replaced it in MacOS.
